<h1> The 5 Programming Languages & Frameworks to Learn in 2020 </h1>

    <h2> 1. Java/Kotlin — Spring Framework</h2>
        <p> Many of you may have asked why Java? Is Java still even exist or popular? 
        The answer is Yes. Choosing to learn any programming language is not 
        just based on popularity metrics or whether the date it got created. 
        Whether you like it or not, Java is still the enterprise standard programming 
        language and it is widely used. The job opportunity is also one of the factors to take into 
        consideration when we choose a programming language to learn.</p>

        <p>Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming 
        language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, 
        and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but 
        type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin originated at JetBrains, 
        the company behind IntelliJ IDEA, in 2010, and has been open source since 2012.</p>

        <p>Spring framework is one of the most popular open-source Java frameworks. 
        It is geared towards the developers and provides an all-round, flexible framework. 
        Spring 5.0 onwards has provided dedicated support for Kotlin. 
        People always compare Kotlin over Java. With Spring, why not we combine both? 
        Since both languages have it’s good and bad.</p>
        
        <p>With the extensions, resources, and documentation found on the Internet, 
        it makes the developers ease to find and adding dependencies required to integrate 
        with different kinds of 3rd party applications.</p>

        <pre>You should consider using when:-
    - Building an enterprise application
    - Building microservice architecture with the popular cloud provider
    - Building a large team with code controls
    - Looking for a framework that easily scalable and resilient
        </pre>

    <h2> 2. Golang</h2>
        <p>Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language 
        created at Google that makes it easy to build simple, reliable and efficient software. 
        The syntax is clean and easy to understand by newcomers.</p>

        <p>The beauty of Go is its first-class support for concurrency. Go doesn’t just support multi-threading, it is multi-threaded by design itself.</p>

        <p>If you are looking for something that lightweight, fast execution and quick development, 
        Go is one of the best choices. The binary file size for Go is way much smaller (10x) compared to the Spring jar file.</p>

        <pre>You should consider using when:
    - Building small and lightweight applications
    - Building for microservice-based container platform
    - Quick development, easy to build, and shorter learning curve
    - Building async & multi-threaded services</pre>

    <h2>3. Python — Django Framework</h2>
        <p>Django framework considered one of the best Python frameworks in building web applications, 
        and it’s free and open-source. Django offers stability, packages, best documentation and it has good community support.</p>

        <p>Django widely used in building CRM, CMS, Booking engines and all kinds of web applications. 
        It supports the fast development of backend APIs with minimal coding.</p>

        <p>Among other things, Django is great for data analysis solutions, complicated computations, and machine learning. 
        It is one of the top picks for developers these days.</p>

        <pre>You should consider using when:-
    - Building large scale web applications
    - API driven applications
    - Don’t mind monolith architecture
    - Data analytics solutions and Machine Learning</pre>
